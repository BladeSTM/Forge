# Forge Lua Engine

__Forge Lua Engine__ is an embedded Lua scripting engine designed for World of Warcraft emulators. It provides powerful scripting capabilities and supports several popular emulators, including MaNGOS, CMaNGOS and TrinityCore.

We are continually working to improve Forge's functionality and performance, and strive to deliver an extensive, intuitive and unified scripting experience across emulators.

If you encounter any issues during installation or while working on scripts, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/ForgeLuaEngine/Forge/issues) or join our community Discord server.
